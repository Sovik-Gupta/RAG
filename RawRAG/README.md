## Key terms

| Term | Description |
| ----- | ----- | 
| **Token** | A sub-word piece of text. For example, "hello, world!" could be split into ["hello", ",", "world", "!"]. A token can be a whole word,<br> part of a word or group of punctuation characters. 1 token ~= 4 characters in English, 100 tokens ~= 75 words.<br> Text gets broken into tokens before being passed to an LLM. |
| **Embedding** | A learned numerical representation of a piece of data. For example, a sentence of text could be represented by a vector with<br> 768 values. Similar pieces of text (in meaning) will ideally have similar values. |
| **Embedding model** | A model designed to accept input data and output a numerical representation. For example, a text embedding model may take in 384 <br>tokens of text and turn it into a vector of size 768. An embedding model can and often is different to an LLM model. |
| **Similarity search/vector search** | Similarity search/vector search aims to find two vectors which are close together in high-demensional space. For example, <br>two pieces of similar text passed through an embedding model should have a high similarity score, whereas two pieces of text about<br> different topics will have a lower similarity score. Common similarity score measures are dot product and cosine similarity. |
| **Large Language Model (LLM)** | A model which has been trained to numerically represent the patterns in text. A generative LLM will continue a sequence when given a sequence. <br>For example, given a sequence of the text "hello, world!", a genertive LLM may produce "we're going to build a RAG pipeline today!".<br> This generation will be highly dependant on the training data and prompt. |
| **LLM context window** | The number of tokens a LLM can accept as input. For example, as of March 2024, GPT-4 has a default context window of 32k tokens<br> (about 96 pages of text) but can go up to 128k if needed. A recent open-source LLM from Google, Gemma (March 2024) has a context<br> window of 8,192 tokens (about 24 pages of text). A higher context window means an LLM can accept more relevant information<br> to assist with a query. For example, in a RAG pipeline, if a model has a larger context window, it can accept more reference items<br> from the retrieval system to aid with its generation. |
| **Prompt** | A common term for describing the input to a generative LLM. The idea of "[prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering)" is to structure a text-based<br> (or potentially image-based as well) input to a generative LLM in a specific way so that the generated output is ideal. This technique is<br> possible because of a LLMs capacity for in-context learning, as in, it is able to use its representation of language to breakdown <br>the prompt and recognize what a suitable output may be (note: the output of LLMs is probable, so terms like "may output" are used). |
